# Substitute Management System

## Overview

This system is designed to simplify and streamline the process of managing substitute teachers. It allows educators and administrators to submit, accept, and track substitute requests efficiently. The system supports user roles, ensuring a tailored experience for teachers, substitutes, and administrators.

## Features

  Substitute teachers are notified of new requests and can accept them via the system.

- **Substitute Dashboard**  
  Substitutes have a dedicated dashboard displaying the requests they have accepted, including details of assigned tasks.

- **Teacher Dashboard**  
  Teachers can track the status of their submitted requests and review past bookings.

- **Admin Dashboard**  
  Administrators can manage users (teachers and substitutes) and view recent and older substitute requests.

- **User Profiles**  
  Detailed user profiles, including roles, past activity, and associated grades or subjects, for efficient management.

- **Role-Based System**  
  The system recognizes distinct roles (teacher, substitute, admin) and provides tailored access and functionality for each.

## Technologies

This system is built using:
- **Backend**: Python (Flask framework)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap included for some components)
